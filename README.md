Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Information Systems Management graduate with a keen interest in coding and system administration. Here's a little about me:

ðŸ”­ I bring over a year of hands-on experience as a Software Developer, with expertise in AWS services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, Amazon Lambda, and Amazon API Gateway API.  
ðŸŒ± I'm proficient in Python and JavaScript, and have practical knowledge of databases including MySQL, SQL, and NoSQL.  
ðŸ‘¯ In addition to technical skills, I have a solid understanding of CI/CD pipelines using Git and GitLab, and experience in project management and task tracking through tools like Jira and Bitbucket.  
ðŸ˜„ Looking ahead, I'm excited about refining my skills, particularly in English proficiency, and expanding my expertise in software development.
